# Resumize(WIP)

## Development Workflow

1. Always work on feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
2. Pull latest before starting work: `git pull --rebase`
3. Commit often with clear messages
4. Push and create PR for review
5. Delete branch after merge

## Git Configuration (Recommended)
```sh
git config pull.rebase true
git config rebase.autoStash true
```
